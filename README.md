# üìã **PHASE II:Business Process Modeling (Related to Management Information Systems - MIS).**


## **1. Define the Scope**

### **üîç Business Process Being Modeled:**

Patient Appointment and Record Management Process

### **üìå Relevance to MIS:**

This process ensures that patient information (appointments, medical records, diagnoses) flows seamlessly between departments, supports timely decision-making, and ensures accurate, up-to-date data access for healthcare professionals.

## **üéØObjectives:**

**‚Ä¢**	Automate patient appointment scheduling.

**‚Ä¢**	Store and manage complete patient records.

**‚Ä¢**	Ensure availability of accurate information for doctors and administrative staff.

**‚Ä¢**	Support data-driven decisions in treatment and operations.

### **‚úÖ Expected Outcomes:**

**‚Ä¢**	Reduced waiting time.

**‚Ä¢**	Improved diagnosis through historical data.

**‚Ä¢**	Enhanced collaboration across departments.

## **2. Identify Key Entities**

### **Entity:**	                                      **Description	Role**

**Patient:**                                            Individual receiving care	Requests appointments, provides personal/medical info

**Receptionist:**	                                      Front desk staff	Manages appointments, updates patient details

**Doctor:**	                                            Medical staff	Reviews patient records, adds diagnoses and prescriptions

**MIS Database:**	                                      Central data store	Stores all patient records, appointments, diagnosis

**System (App):**	                                      User interface	Allows staff and patients to interact with the system

**Admin	System manager:**	                              Manages access control and data quality

## **6. Explanation of the BPMN Diagram**

## **üß© Main Components & Interactions:**


**‚Ä¢	Patient:** Initiates the process by providing personal and medical information.

**‚Ä¢	Receptionist:** Registers the patient and schedules an appointment.
