# 📋 **PHASE II:Business Process Modeling (Related to Management Information Systems - MIS).**


## **🎲1. Define the Scope**

### **🔍 Business Process Being Modeled:**

Patient Appointment and Record Management Process

### **📌 Relevance to MIS:**

This process ensures that patient information (appointments, medical records, diagnoses) flows seamlessly between departments, supports timely decision-making, and ensures accurate, up-to-date data access for healthcare professionals.

## **🎯Objectives:**

**•**	Automate patient appointment scheduling.

**•**	Store and manage complete patient records.

**•**	Ensure availability of accurate information for doctors and administrative staff.

**•**	Support data-driven decisions in treatment and operations.

### **✅ Expected Outcomes:**

**•**	Reduced waiting time.

**•**	Improved diagnosis through historical data.

**•**	Enhanced collaboration across departments.

## **🎲2. Identify Key Entities**

### **Entity:**	                                      **Description	Role**

**Patient:**                                            Individual receiving care	Requests appointments, provides personal/medical info

**Receptionist:**	                                      Front desk staff	Manages appointments, updates patient details

**Doctor:**	                                            Medical staff	Reviews patient records, adds diagnoses and prescriptions

**MIS Database:**	                                      Central data store	Stores all patient records, appointments, diagnosis

**System (App):**	                                      User interface	Allows staff and patients to interact with the system

**Admin	System manager:**	                              Manages access control and data quality

## **🎲6. Explanation of the BPMN Diagram**

## **🧩 Main Components & Interactions:**


**•	Patient:** Initiates the process by providing personal and medical information.

**•	Receptionist:** Registers the patient and schedules an appointment.

**•	Doctor:** Accesses the patient’s record at appointment time and performs an examination.

**•	MIS Database:** Updates and stores all information—appointments, examinations, diagnoses.

**•	System:** Facilitates data entry, retrieval, and workflow transitions across actors.



## **🧠 How the Process Supports MIS Functions**

**•	Decision-Making:** Doctors have immediate access to patient history, improving diagnostic accuracy.

**•	Operational Efficiency:** Reduces paperwork and manual scheduling; automates routine tasks.

**•	Data Integrity:** Ensures up-to-date, secure, and centralized data storage.

**•	Monitoring & Evaluation:** Admins can review system logs and performance indicators.

_
## **🏥 Importance for Organizational Efficiency**

**•**	Reduces administrative burden on staff.

**•**	Eliminates double-entry errors.

**•**	Speeds up patient handling and reporting.

**•**	Ensures traceability and accountability across all stages of the patient care process.
